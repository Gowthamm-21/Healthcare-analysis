# Healthcare-analysis
A data analytics project analyzing 50,000+ healthcare records to uncover patient trends, disease distribution, admission patterns, and operational insights using Excel and SQL.

# Healthcare Data Analysis Using Excel and SQL

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing a large healthcare dataset to extract meaningful insights related to patient demographics, disease patterns, hospital admissions, length of stay, and treatment costs. The analysis is performed using **Microsoft Excel** for data preprocessing and visualization, and **SQL** for querying and advanced analytical operations.

The project demonstrates practical data analytics skills applied to a real-world healthcare scenario.

---

## 📊 Excel Analysis
- Cleaned raw healthcare data
- Created calculated fields (length of stay, percentages)
- Built pivot tables for:
  - Disease-wise patient count
  - Department-wise admissions
  - Treatment cost distribution
- Visualized insights using charts

📸 *Excel screenshots are included in the project documentation.*

---

## 🗄 SQL Analysis
The dataset was imported into a relational database and analyzed using SQL.

### Sample Queries:
- Total patients count
- Disease-wise admissions
- Department-wise patient distribution
- Average length of stay
- High-cost and high-risk departments
- Month-wise and year-wise admission trends

📸 *SQL query execution screenshots are included in the project report.*

---

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Emergency departments account for higher admission volumes and costs
- Chronic diseases show longer average hospital stays
- Certain departments have disproportionately high treatment costs
- Length of stay significantly impacts overall treatment expenses
- Admission trends vary across months and years

---

## ⚠ Dataset Limitations
- No geographic hospital location data
- Disease severity levels not provided
- Currency for treatment cost not specified
- Some aggregated fields mixed with raw data

---

## 📘 Learning Outcomes
- Hands-on experience with large datasets
- Strong understanding of Excel pivot tables and data cleaning
- Practical SQL querying and analytical thinking
- Real-world exposure to healthcare analytics
- Improved data interpretation and reporting skills

---

## ✅ Conclusion
This project highlights how **Excel and SQL can be effectively combined** to analyze large-scale healthcare data. The insights generated can support operational improvements and data-driven decision-making in healthcare environments.
